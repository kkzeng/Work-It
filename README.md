# work-it-sourcefiles
A Java-based workout management solution built for trainers and trainees. 
Includes a bunch of features like automatic customized workouts generated based on user stats, prebuilt workouts, progress summary
for trainers, user management and even a "messaging system". Requires Google Drive, Dropbox or other file sharing services to be used with.
This was made for the personal trainer in my high school based on his requirements following a software development cycle including multiple
interviews and meetups discussing requirements and needed changes (following an agile model)
